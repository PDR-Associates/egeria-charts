LF AI & Data Egeria lab tutorial
---

The Egeria tutorials have now been deployed to Kubernetes.
It may take a minute or so for everything to start up.

Refer to https://egeria-project.org/guides/operations/kubernetes/k8s/?h=nodeport#accessing-applications-in-your-cluster to setup access to the services you need to access in your cluster.

If you experience problems, check memory consumption on your nodes. A minimum of
12GB free is recommended. Dashboards, or the command line tool k9s ( https://k9scli.io ) are useful for this.

Please provide any feeback via a github issue at https://github.com/odpi/egeria-charts or
join us on slack via https://slack.lfaiaidata.foundation
